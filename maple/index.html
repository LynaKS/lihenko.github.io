					Planning your big day:
				</h3>
				<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many weddings and other significant events originally planned for 2020 were postponed or canceled. However, with Pennsylvania lifting nearly all COVID-19 restrictions on Memorial Day 2021, now is the time to start planning gatherings again.</p>
				<p>We are currently offering event options: X, Y, Z. Though each option is geared towards a different type of event, we offer upfront pricing so you will never be surprised with any hidden fees or additional charges.</p>
				<p>At 50ACF, you will work directly with our staff and vendors who know our location and how to best manage your event. We have worked with numerous local catering services and party planning companies who can help you create the event of your dreams. As every event is different, we also understand if you would like to supply your own food, beverages, and decorations.</p>

				<p>With budget friendly options and multiple event spaces, we can help you create the event of your dreams no matter your budget or desired style. Whether you are looking to have 50ACF farm estate host a wedding in our rustic barn venue or a corporate event in our modern event unit, we can help you find the perfect décor for your big day. For example, we work with local nurseries to supply fresh flower arrangements as well as connect you with popular event planners who can outfit your event space with blossoms in glasses and jars, add ambient lightening such as string lights, and whatever other personal touches you desire.</p>  
				<p>With over two decades of experience, 50ACF understands that sometimes the best events are the ones that you and your loved ones plan yourselves. Thus, we offer a plan that allows you to save on your event package by preparing our spaces yourself.  Further, if you already have a catering company picked out, we will work directly with them to ensure that your day goes as planned.</p>  
				<p>You have a choice of multiple rustic indoor and outdoor spaces for your ceremony, reception, or other special event. The most popular event space is our historic barn, as it is warmly referred to by many of our guests as “the barn from the past.” Included in this space is the main barn, another associated farm building at the entrance of the property, a large outdoor space surrounded by our centuries old stonewall, and the waterfall. Each of these amenities have been well preserved to lend a “casually rustic” country feeling to your celebration.</p>

					About the Farm:
				</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 mb-5">
				<p>The 50 Acre Farm Estate (WWW.50ACF.com), established in the mid-1800s is a more than one-hundred-and-fifty-year-old farm with waterfalls and creeks situated on 50 private acres. Before it was purchased by the current owner of the property, it was a local dairy farm that supplied much of the surrounding region for over a century. This historic farmstead  is registered with the National Register Program, Bureau for Historic Preservation in Harrisburg PA. First mentioned in the Civil War Draft Registration in 1863, the Farm is a historic American protected asset. </p>

					Introduction:
				</h3>
				<p>Perfect for weddings, birthday parties, corporate gatherings, and other special events, this unique property offers stunning views of the endless mountains along with the waterfall and stream located on the property. The owner’s main home is a Palladio style inspired residency built with field stone and local materials to match the landscape. It is located at the top of the property, overlooking the fifty-acre farm.</p>

				<p>In general, the environment of the entire property is cozy and scenic. A perfect setting for entertaining. It is a spectacular private estate with great panoramic views of the countryside. Many of those who visit the estate compare the views to those seen in Tuscany, Italy.</p>
				<p>This classic and stylish private estate is kept as a farm. The land and certain buildings are used to occasionally grow crops and raise livestock. However, it is well maintained and has a long driveway from the street level up the top of the hill. The waterfalls are on the right side of the private street entrance to the property. On top of the property, you overlook the fabulous scenery of the Back Mountains.</p> 

				<p>The entire estate was created to make every guest feel at home so they can chat, drink, and have fun while enjoying your special day. The outside landscape is great in all four seasons. From overgrown foliage from trees, bushes, and vines to old grown Rhododendron, Trumpet flowers, and wild climbers, the native plants make the foliage a part of the unique space.</p> 
				<p>While the native greenery is an important part of the estate, the waterfalls located at the front of the property are simply incredible and the most popular spot for guest photos.</p>
