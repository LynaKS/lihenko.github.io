					<h3>Coverage and use</h3>
					<p>The main virtue of PH0R4 is that it stays true to its word. Many other Wi-Fi extenders fail to achieve the coverage they claim in the advertising, but it is not the case with PH0R4. Many happy customers confirm that PH0R4 works as promised, doubling the coverage area and eliminating dead spots in a matter of seconds. And for that, we shall pay homage to the dual built-in antenna that extends signal coverage and boosts the speed of your internet connection. PH0R4 is suited for a connection speed of up to 300Mbp, meaning that you can watch multiple high-resolution movies at once while simultaneously gaming or participating in a video conference. No buffering, no dead zones, fast loading speed, and utmost reliability – that, by definition, is PH0R4. </p>

There is absolutely no need to pay for your internet service provider to upgrade your internet plan because it is unlikely to improve anything. PH0R4 is the optimal solution for those who want to finally surf the internet in peace, without being disrupted by constant disconnections and slow speed. PH0R4 has been praised for its impeccable input towards a better internet connection. Try it out yourself!</p>
