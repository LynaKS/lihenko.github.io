					<h2><span class="blue">Our Top Pick:</span> <span class="green">PH0R4</span></h2>
					<p>As of today, we can't imagine our life without an internet connection, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. We utilize the internet for entertainment purposes, such as watching the latest movies, shows, or playing games. The internet also helps immensely to research different topics, whether it's curiosity or duty, that drives you. Not to mention that so many people work from home, participate in business meetings, and complete assignments online! After all, thanks to the internet, we can connect with our extended family or friends who live abroad and have a lovely chat with the ones we miss most. Now that we've made it perfectly clear that there is nothing wrong with relying on the internet for various purposes, a new question arises.</p> 

					<p><strong>What to do if my internet connection simply doesn't work as well as I would want it to work?</strong> Maybe your video calls keep buffering, maybe downloading a movie takes ages, maybe loading a page takes an eternity. All of these issues are very real and somewhat frustrating. You certainly don't want to miss an important call or to submit a work assignment too late because of poor internet or dead zones around your house. Now, you may contact your internet service provider and ask to upgrade your monthly plan. However, here's the trick: they want you to do that and, chances are, your internet connection will hardly improve. That is why so many people have turned to Wi-Fi boosters. Now that you've stumbled across our list of Wi-Fi extenders see why PH0R4 is ultimately the best product of this kind available today. Forget about poor internet connection and unreliable signal! PH0R4 is here to change the game forever.</p>  
				</div>
				<div id="reasons-for-poor-connectivity">
					<h3>Reasons for poor connectivity</h3>
					<p>There is a long list of issues that may contribute to a poor internet connection. And if you're not somewhat tech-savvy, the chances are that you might struggle to identify the problem with your Wi-Fi connection. Yes, buffering internet can be a direct result of software malfunction or computer viruses, but there are other simpler reasons for a poor internet connection. It simply may be the case of your router box unable to cover an entire house, leaving you with several Wi-Fi dead zones across the house. Dead zones are produced when something interferes with Wi-Fi radio waves or, in some cases, when Wi-Fi cannot extend its signal through the whole building. It could be because the floorplan and building materials in old houses sometimes interfere with the Wi-Fi signal. For example, some walls in old homes contain chicken wire for support, and this could block your Wi-Fi signal. Other things that could interfere with your Wi-Fi include old cordless phones, microwave ovens, baby monitors, wireless security systems, and wireless sound systems – all of these devices are known to cause Wi-Fi issues. The list of reasons doesn't end here, but you get the main idea: it is not always your computer that is at fault for buffering connection, it's a bunch of external factors as well. But how can one improve the situation, you may ask? It is quite evident that one will not rebuild the house so as to get rid of metal wirings. As you might have already guessed, your solution is a Wi-Fi extender, and PH0R4 is our favorite!</p> 
				</div>
				<div id="how-wi-fi-extenders-work">
					<h3>How Wi-Fi extenders work</h3>
					<p>Wi-Fi extender, booster, or repeater – whatever you call it, there is no magic here. Essentially, a Wi-Fi booster extends the coverage area of your Wi-Fi network by receiving an existing Wi-Fi signal from your router, amplifying it, and then transmitting the boosted signal around the house or office building. Our favorite, PH0R4, has been demonstrating exceptional performance in this matter. It can effectively double the coverage area and reach even the farthest corners of the building, go through multiple floors, or even extend Wi-Fi coverage to outdoors or a basement. This can really come in handy if you have a game console down there and can’t get a reliable signal or simply want to surf the internet while chilling outside in the garden. In other words, a Wi-Fi booster creates a second network that is transmitted more broadly. While they all work in the same manner, some Wi-Fi boosters exceed everyone's expectations, and this is precisely what PH0R4 does. Whether you are a gamer, a work-from-home parent, a movie enthusiast, or a student, it doesn't matter what you do. With PH0R4, it's not internet surfing anymore – it's smooth sailing.</p> 
				</div>
				<div id="how-to-use">
					<h3>How to use my Wi-Fi extender</h3>
					<p>Because the device is not complicated in itself, it's also fairly straightforward using it. Just plug it in a power outlet, connect to the existing Wi-Fi network, and enjoy the benefits of fast and reliable internet. PH0R4 is no exception when it comes to installing your booster. All you have to do is find a power socket to power the device, follow the installment instructions that are included in the box, and surf the internet like never before! PH0R4 has been praised by customers worldwide because of its simplicity and effectiveness. Due to its exceptional ability to quickly eliminate dead zones (or dead spots, as some may call it) and improve connection in every corner of the house, PH0R4 has marked itself as one of the best Wi-Fi extenders available today. Having secured its place at the top of the market, PH0R4 is such a desired device that manufacturers even struggle with providing enough supply! Check this device yourself before it runs out of stock again!</p>
