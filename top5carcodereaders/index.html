					<h2><span class="blue">Our Top Pick:</span> <span class="green">Automend Pro</span></h2>
					<p>To most of us, car maintenance is a mysterious subject and a field we don't want to step in unless our vehicles light up with a million warning lights. It is also old news that mechanics at car services are not particularly interested in fixing your vehicle quickly and efficiently. They better charge you unreasonable sums of money for a simple check-over and then ask for even more to fix a problem. In other words, you enter the car service knowing nothing and have to believe whatever these mechanics say to you. Well, you could easily avoid this issue if you were to have an OBD scanner: a device that reads your car code and then lets you know precisely what is wrong with your vehicle.</p>
					<p>Knowledge is power, and if you were to know the exact problem of your car, the mechanics at the car service would never be able to deceive you and charge more than is needed. With that being said, we would like to present you with the best car code reader our team of experts could find today. We ran many tests, compared each device on this list, and based on objective evidence, we concluded that Automend Pro is second to none. This little car code reader can troubleshoot over 7,000 vehicle problems and estimate repair costs so that mechanics have no chance of scamming you.</p>
					<p>Automend Pro can show meticulous car diagnostics in the simplest of terms so that even someone unfamiliar with mechanics could understand. Not to forget that Automend Pro monitors your car in real-time so that you would instantly know if something were to go out of order. Despite the similarities between such devices, no other OBD scanner could compare to Automend Pro. Read more to find out why. </p> 
				</div>
				<div id="reasons-for-poor-connectivity">
					<h3>Why code readers are necessary</h3>
					<p>There often is a great deal of confusion regarding car maintenance and OBD (On-board diagnostics) scanners. Women usually turn to fathers and husbands to fix these problems for them. Still, not every man can troubleshoot a specific problem because mechanics is a deep field where basic knowledge may not always suffice. That's when OBD scanners come in handy. The main question is: what does it do, and why do I need one?  In simplest terms, a car code reader (also known as an OBD scanner) allows the owner of a vehicle to identify issues quicker and more accurately. An OBD scanner is a tiny device that is plugged into the vehicle's OBD port. Then, it can return a generic car code that a skilled mechanic can use to identify a fix. Such devices are helpful not only for experienced mechanics but for regular car owners as well. A car code reader, like our number one Automend Pro, can show the exact problem of your vehicle, explain why the check engine light is on, help with preventative maintenance, troubleshoot over 7,000 vehicle problems, and save you a great deal of money. That way, when you get your car to a service, you tell them what to do, not the other way around.</p> 
				</div>
				<div id="how-wi-fi-extenders-work">
					<h3>How car code readers work</h3>
					<p>The OBD scanner reads a code that is already programmed into the car by the vehicle's manufacturer. If the system determines that something is out of the ordinary, it sets a "trouble code" that can be used in further diagnostic procedures. Each code responds to a specific issue, and your car code reader can easily show you where the problem lies. Once a trouble code is set, an indicator lamp lights up. This lamp is usually referred to as the check engine light. Without a car code reader, this process of identifying problems would be trial and error: guessing possible faults but never being entirely sure. This blind way of fault search requires a lot of time, money, and effort, and that is why a car code reader is a helping hand of utmost significance. However, choosing the best OBD scanner for your vehicle could be a bit of a challenge. There are so many to choose from in today's market, but after scrutinized research, our team of experts came to a unified conclusion that Automend Pro showcases a superior performance and the best features.</p> 
				</div>
				<div id="how-to-use">
					<h3>How to use a car code reader?</h3>
					<p>You don’t have to be a skilled mechanic to use Automend Pro. What you must do at first is plug your device into an OBD system. The connector's location differs from vehicle to vehicle, but in most cases, it is either under the hood in the vicinity of the fuse box or under the dash. So, what are the main steps of using a car code reader? After you've located the port, insert the code reader and turn it on if your unit doesn't power on automatically. Then, turn the vehicle's ignition switch to the accessory position and follow the scanner's on-screen prompts. This procedure may differ depending on your code reader, but these devices are usually very straightforward to use. Most car code readers, including Automend Pro, feature a mobile application that shows all the necessary diagnostics in one convenient place. Need to troubleshoot a problem? Automend Pro is here to help you. Need to estimate the repair cost? Automend Pro will calculate it for you so you don't get scammed by mechanics at the car service. It is old news that finding a trustworthy mechanic is rare these days, and they usually charge a hefty price for the simplest of tasks. Even a quick check-over of the vehicle can cost you a fortune! This would never happen if you were to use a car code reader and knew all of the issues beforehand.</p>
