							<p><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #6E87A2;">What happened:</span> The housing market has a chance to remain red hot through 2021.</p>

							<p><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #6E87A2;">What it means:</span> Glenn Kelman, Redfin CEO, believes that the housing market can get even hotter than it is currently. He points to the fact that interest rates are at all-time lows and will remain low through 2021 and once people feel comfortable letting other people in their homes, he feels more supply will come on the market thus helping ease the demand.</p>

							<p>He states that there will be a bust sometime in the future, but he cannot predict when it will be as we are in a massive boom right now (Per Redfin - Median Sale Price: Single Family Home- $350,000 / Condos - $277,000). However, this boom is very different than the boom of the early 2000’s, which was a finance-fueled boom. Unlike in the early 2000’s this boom is driven off demand, less speculation, and less predatory lending.</p>
							<p>As he points out, wealthier people that live in high cost of living states are now moving out of those states because they can and working remotely has been made much easier. The top 5 cities in Q2 that experienced outflows were New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and Chicago. With New York State, California, and Illinois in severe financial ruins, the exodus of people from these states is not going to stop anytime soon. On the flip side Phoenix, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Austin, and Atlanta saw a boom of people moving to their cities in Q2 of 2020. One could expect Phoenix, Austin, and Las Vegas to continue to see large inflows through 2021 as the people from high-cost areas in California and other West Coast states look to move to more reasonable costing areas. The same can be said for Atlanta and potentially other southern cities, which are cheaper as more and more New Yorkers and Northeast residents flee the cold and high cost of living areas they current reside in.</p>

							<p>Therefore, if you live in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Austin anticipate your home values to continue to grow at a pace that is more than the national average as supply will more than likely remain constrained due to the high demand. If you are wanting to live in New York City and Chicago you should be able to find some really good deals. These cities will eventually bounce back, but it will take some time. Finally, if you are a homeowner in most cities the value of your home should continue to rise, thus increasing your net worth and liquidity even more in 2021.</p>
